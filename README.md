# BitBrainCoin
BitBrain's  A.I. Analytical coin Wallets, Source, and brief Description of Vision and Aim.

Forethcoming shall be a coin with the purpose of bringing A.I. analytics into maintream crypto by providing an analytical system 
regarding
the trading of cryptocurrencies.
Using Proprietary methods and API already in place on sites such as coingecko, we are able to calculate within 85% accuracy the trading 
trends of any market that we applied our systems to. We want to pass this on to the rest of the community in an easy to use format.

We will be implementing a Technology Trading Platformâ„¢ where you can trade in Our coin for New computers, parts, and even send in your
computer for custom work. The custom work will be backed by A+ certified technicians but will however not have a return policy outside 
of 
manufacturer's warranty. The computers and parts will be under manufacturer warranty with a 30 day coin back guarantee.

After Implementation of these two above goals, we will launch The BitBrain's Decentraleized Exchange(BDE). We have studied proprietary 
security measures and flaws in exchange systems that lead to theft and exit scams. We aim to improve the security of funds of our 
partners 
and clients.

All code and wallets are to be released based upon community size, this depends on growth. We estimate 1552075320 unix time.


BitBrainCoin Core 1.0.0
=====================

Intro
-----
BitBrainCoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run bitbraincoin-qt.exe.

BitBrainCoin Core is the original BitBrainCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of BitBrainCoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
